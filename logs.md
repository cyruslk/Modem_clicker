Under the guidance of Pippin Barr, I'm approaching [DiSalvo](http://carldisalvo.com/)'s Adversarial Design applied to the context of (online) Game Design. Adversarial Design is a reference to Chantal Mouffe's notion of [Agonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonism).

------

"Agonism is a condition of disagreement and confrontation—a condition of contestation and dissensus. Those who espouse an agonistic approach to democracy encourage contestation and dissensus as fundamental to democracy." (DiSalvo, 2015)

"To claim that adversarial design does the work of agonism means that designed objects can function to prompt recognition of political issues and relations, express dissensus, and enable contestational claims and arguments." (DiSalvo, 2015)

DiSalvo's Adversarial Design consequently aims to approach design as a strategy to **embody Agonism**. In other words, Adversarial Design aims to do  **- through design strategies and dynamics -** "the work of Agonism".

In the [Master's Thesis Draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wq8xWYlTZ7X-dRnMwLcv9QUrnFLvfM-mthPl4srZJ48/edit?usp=sharing) I'm currently working on, I investigating internet from three different yet related *tensions* inherent to its materiality. I laid down these thoughts through this sort of manifesto:

-  "On the one hand, the internet appears as an immaterial system, characterised by light minimal user interfaces and clouds of data. On the hand, **internet is operated by a series of (wired) physical components: ranging from undersea cables, modems and routers**."

-  "On the one hand, internet appears as a silent stack of protocols, performing their actions transparently. On the other hand, **internet originated from sounds/sonic agencies; noisy telephone lines, using screeching modems in order to establish connections**."

-  "On the one hand, the internet appears as an immediate system of data transmission, characterized by a perfect data flow. On the other hand, **internet is punctuated by delays, failures and other frequent protocol anomalies**."

TO COME :

- [x] Protocols?
- [x] Internet's materiality vs ISP's marketing strategies?
- [x] Reveal/Explore internet's Materiality? Why?
- [x] Protocols: embeded values on language?
- [ ] Using Modems to make these values tangible?
- [ ] Translations?

This fact that internet is a messy, physical, odd, weird, delayed, irregular (and so on) network (or should I say infrastructure, which relates in my sense to a  much more tangible and concrete entity) highly interests me. While working on a previous game (the [MODEMGUESSINGGAME](https://github.com/cyruslk/MODEMGUESSINGGAME)), I read two books that highly influenced my thoughts and helped me reframe my ideas.

------

- [x] Protocols?

The first one is [Protocol: How Control Exists after Decentralization](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/protocol) by Alexander Galloway. I detailed the intersections between Galloway's book and my researches in [these logs](https://github.com/cyruslk/MODEMGUESSINGGAME/blob/master/logs.md) so I won't go back to the core ideas of the book; except that, to make it simple, even if Internet's infrastructure is distributed, there is a whole embeded system of **control and structure** in it; and **it resides largly in internet's transmitting protocols**.

There's a lot of [research being made these days](https://socialmediacollective.org/reading-lists/critical-algorithm-studies/) about the fact that Algorithms are normative apparatuses imposing on us their agency. But reading Galloway's Protocol made me realised that very little was made in order to investigate **from a critical perspective** the infrastucture where these algorithms operate (as well as others components of internet - all having an agency on the system itself - internet).

**Galloway's Protocol made me realize that transmitting protocols need consequently to be questioned, and that we need as scholars and researchers question the way they perform on us; the way they impose their embeded set of values and rules on us.**

------

The other one is [The Undersea Network](https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-undersea-network) by Nicole Starosielski.In her book, Starosielski investigates internet's physical infrastructure by exploring the role, the characteristics and the specificities of its [undersea cables](https://theconversation.com/in-our-wi-fi-world-the-internet-still-depends-on-undersea-cables-49936).

At the begining of the book, Starosielski clearly states that these cables "**transport 99 percent of all transoceanic digital communications**, including phone calls, text and e-mail messages, websites, digital images and video, and even some television (...). It is submarine systems, rather than satellites, that carry most of the Internet across the oceans." (Starosielski, 2015)

This consequently reveals that internet has a materiality, and that (part of) its materiality is tangible, geographically located; and that because internet was crafted this way, it enables all sorts of practices and counter-practices ([sabotages](https://globalnews.ca/news/4115233/russia-sabotage-undersea-fiber-optic-cables/), [resistance](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/28/egypt-undersea-cable-arrests) and [so on](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access)).

- [x] Internet's materiality vs ISP's marketing strategies?

However, what struck me the most through this book is the general position ISP (Internet Service Providers) defend regarding internet's infrastructure, following the idea that if "**the public doesn’t know about the importance of undersea cables, they will not think to contest or disrupt them.**" (Starosielski, 2015)

------

"Ash, who has worked for decades on undersea cable design and installation, he pressed me on my interest in making cables visible. “**Why would you want to know?**” he asked. “When you turn on a computer and you send an e-mail, do you really care how it works? No, you just want e-mail there, and you start drumming the table if it takes thirty seconds." (Starosielski, 2015)

I took some time to build and reflect on my last bot, the [slow sender meme bot](https://github.com/cyruslk/debord_slow_sender_meme). From [2XTWEETSXMODEMSXTEXTXTWEET](https://twitter.com/2XTXMXTXT) to [OROBOROGRAM](https://twitter.com/oroborogram), [PROCEDURAL_HAÏKUS](https://twitter.com/d__w__h) and these modem games/interactions I'll dive in very soon, there's definitely  body of problematics and investigations.

- [x] Reveal/Explore internet's Materiality? Why?

- CONTEXT : From this excerpt of Starosielski's book, ISP (and other private agents providing access internet) are striving to label internet as **a black-box**.

  A black-box is defined by **its opaque** characteristics. When we talk about a blak-box, we usually don't know the box itself: we know the inputs (the data passed in) and the outputs (the data *returned*) of this box without any knowledge of its internal workings.

  Approaching internet (and computers) as an ecology of black-boxes is frequent. From social-medias apps with [opaque ways to manage our datas](https://www.propublica.org/article/breaking-the-black-box-what-facebook-knows-about-you) to [algorithms](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) (with biases that we can't decrypt due do copyright), internet is composed of a variety of opaque boxes.

  This makes internet a very political space, where we - as citizens - are not aware of what's going on behind the curtains and are not in total control of our interactions with these spaces.

- CONTEXT : In addition, it's also clear that **code is law** - as Lawrence Lessig said it in his    [Code version 2.0'](http://codev2.cc/download+remix/Lessig-Codev2.pdf)s book. From protocols, to algorithms and therefore source code  (programming languages used to code and their embeded logics), internet is an ecology of values, norms and laws to abide by.

- CONTEXT : To draw on Golloway's Protocols, these components are where internet's system of control and structure reside. It's because these components are crafted these ways/enable these affordances and these possibilities that ISP and other agents are able to [monitor, listen and store our data,](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/all-the-data-facebook-google-has-on-you-privacy) change the ([spatio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_blocking)/[temporal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_throttling)) characteristics of the network and so on and so on.

- STATEMENT : Consequently, exploring (or questioning, revealing, breaking) the way internet (through its materiality) operate is in my sense a very political and subersive act.

  These thoughts are related to what [Experimental Jetset](https://www.experimentaljetset.nl/) expressed in their [Statement and Counter-Statement](https://www.experimentaljetset.nl/250/) book/index of interviews. I came across these thoughts three years ago and they still have an important impact on my approach of design.

  **Debord, Guy**

  "Right after we graduated from the Gerrit Rietveld Academie, there was a period in which we were really influenced by Guy Debord's *The Society of the Spectacle* (1967), especially the first chapter.
  Althought this was just a short period, the impact of this book is still showing in our work. In *The Society of the Spectacle*, Debord critically describes a society dominated by images and representations, and the alientation caused by this.
  We really agreed with this critique, and were thinking of ways to intrgrate it into our design work.

  We translated Debord's theory in a quite literal (and maybe slightly naive) way: we tried to design in a "non-representative" manner. **In other words, we wanted to design objects that would function not as images, but as material objects. Objects that would point to the physical world, the material base that was hidden underneath the world of images.**
  To give an example of this: we decided to never use photography in our work, as we believed that photography (especially full-color photogaphy) would imprison the viewer in an illusion, in a false representation of reality. For instance, when designing a poster, we would use typography only, so that the poster would be recognizable as just a printed piece of paper, not as an image. That also explains the use of white/empty space in our work: we want the viewer to use the paper itself, to cut through the world of images, and see the material base behind it. **By constantly referring to the material base behind everything, we want to make the viewer aware that this world is a makeable world, a world that is made by humans (and thus also has the potential to be changed by humans).**

  Nowadays, our views are a little less dogmatic. For an example, we new use photography in our work, occasionally.**But we're still very interested in the concept of design that refers to the material base: design that refers to itself, or to its own context."**

I would also like to show here a serie of images/projects that had an impact on my thoughts and initiated in a way these modems projects and bots. I'll drop them here and explain how they relate to my researches.

- DISRUPTING THE FLOW


![alt text](https://66.media.tumblr.com/71a52c9b3787764fe53763f5dcdef63a/tumblr_o4zdxwrgGf1qixa76o1_640.png)




This image comes from [this project](http://theartofgooglebooks.tumblr.com/). It's basically a Google employee's Hand captured while digitalizing a book; contributing on Google's initiative/attemps to create "[the largest online body of human knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Books)". This image is very interesting because it reveals the process (by showing its failure). In other words it reveals that even if Google attempted to create a digital (and then smooth, seamless) archive of knowledge, this failed because of the Human intervention - because of the underlying Human factor. This image consequently disrupt the flow (and the Blackbox) Google attempted to create.

This image comes from [this project](http://9-eyes.com/). It's basically a guy throwing a bottle of coca-cola to the [Google Street View](https://www.google.com/streetview/understand/) car. This is also interesting because it shows the failure behind the "semingless" attempt: it shows the incident that goes against the appearance Google is communicating and - again - disrupt a smooth characteristics of the initiative.

- FROM MAPS TO TERRITORIES (...AND TRAJECTORIES)

This comes from [this project](http://theartofgooglebooks.tumblr.com/). It's a scan of the circulation slip with the dates when the book was borrowed. What I like with this image is that it reveals that these scans are a) coming from a physical object and that b) this object had therefore a trajectory in a variety of contexts.

This image is a [Byzantine Icon with a watermark on top](https://www.google.ca/search?q=watermarked+byzantine+icon&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiy_8Se5sXeAhUFm-AKHRTkBjsQ_AUIDigB&biw=1593&bih=857). Here there's a double trajectory happening inside the image: a) from the geographically located painting to the digitalized photo (the icon without losing aura); and b) from the photo to this watermarked Stock photo. What I like here is 1) that the image shows both part of the process and the final form and 2) that each of these shown trajectories are impacting the final form of the object.


- TRANSLATIONS THROUGH THE AFFORDANCES/RESTRICTIONS OF TOOLS


![alt text](http://res.cloudinary.com/www-c-t-l-k-com/image/upload/v1541709066/vd_qebzg1.jpg)

This image is a portrait of me by my grandma. It had been made in the context of a project I initiated for a publication asking researchers to reflect on perception. Through this project, I wanted to reflect on the role of the tool: on how the rool is impacting through its embeded affordances/restrictions the way we interact and perceive.  I was also interested to explore the way one language/state (words?) is being translated into another one (drawings?) and how this translation affects the information being passed.



# 2018-11-08 | 20:01

Started to work on the server side of the project. The main file of the server side is `server.js`. I'll work with `express` in order to manage the route between the server and the client (made using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)).

I'm also install socket.io both on the server and the client (React.js). ["Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server."](https://socket.io/docs/)



# 2018-11-09 | 11:37

I'll work with socket.io because it will help me to pass *in real time* data between the server and the client. By using sockets, I will be able to pass a variety of user's inputs from the client to the server side without **having to refresh the page.**

Here's a list of user's inputs I could use for this project using React's [SyntheticEvent](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html):

- Mouse coordinates + Mouse clicks
- Wheel events?
- Keyboard events?
- Media Events?

------

I'm finishing *Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System*, by Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost. This book is really interesting because it clearly shows how interactions (through the case study of the Atari Computer System) depends on the physicality of their underlying Platform: the cartridge, the microprocessor and so on.

It also clearly reflect that a design (and art) practice is always embeded into what Donald Schön calls a "reflection-in-action" process. The game designers and engineers behind *Tank*, *Combat*, *Pac-Man* and others were reflecting *in action* on their processes and ways to solve the variety of problems they encountered.

------

I'm in the process of building the core interactions between the `server` and the `client` side.

For now, the client side is able to send/receive data coming from the server. Here, the `Hello World` text is coming from the server and when I submit data using the input, it's sent to the server.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%202018-11-09%20%C3%A0%2012.14.45.png)

This idea is now to implement `sockets` in order to send data in real time without having to refresh the client page.

EDIT 1: I now have a script that displays the mouse coordinates. The idea is to pass these coordinates to the server now.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%202018-11-09%20%C3%A0%2016.45.16.png)


EDIT 2: In the `server.js`, I'm now able to retreive these coordinates using the `socket.on()` method of `socket.io`.

Here's the code where these coordinates are logged:

```
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    // console.log(socket.id);
    socket.on('SEND_COORDINATES', function(data){
        console.log(data);
        io.emit('RECEIVE_COORDINATES', data);
    })
});
```

Here is a screenshot of my terminal:
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%202018-11-09%20%C3%A0%2017.15.20.png)


EDIT 3: In the `App.js` of my client  side, I'm now able to retrieve the data sent from the server (and initiated on the client side). Here's the code where I'm logging this data:

    this.socket = io('localhost:5000');
        this.socket.on('RECEIVE_COORDINATES', function(data){
        console.log("this is the data", data);
        });
Here is a screenshot of my browser's console:
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%202018-11-09%20%C3%A0%2017.05.46.png)


EDIT 4: In the `App.js` again, I'm now able to retrieve the data coming from the server and display it in the webpage. This is the code I'm using here:

        this.socket = io('localhost:5000');
        this.socket.on('RECEIVE_COORDINATES', (data) => {
            this.setState({
              xx: data.x,
              yy: data.y
            })
        });
As soon as the data is in the [state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html), I'm displaying it like this:

```
<div>
	{this.state.xx}, {this.state.yy}
</div>
```

Here is a screenshot of my browser's console. The first set of coordinates are coming from the browser - the last ones from the server.

This is the [Simple Net Art Diagram](http://www.mtaa.net/mtaaRR/off-line_art/snad.html). It's very significative of the Net Art movement; and this image had a lot of imapct on my researches and my design practice. What I like with this is that it's quite absurd  - and at the same time very poetic. It clearly shows here that *the art* resides in the network, in the in-between spaces behind the objects; and that *the art* is more an interaction than a concrete and defined object   

![alt text](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T12/T12328_10.jpg)



[Cildo Meireles. *Insertions into Ideological Circuits: Coca-Cola Project* (1970)](https://www.daros-latinamerica.net/ensayo/cildo-meireles-insertions-ideological-circuits) In short, this project is located on the economic circuit of the coca-cola bottle inside the Brazilian chain of production and supply. Subversive messages ("YANKEES GO HOME!", recipes to create a Molotov cocktail) are written in white on these bottles. Therefore, when the bottle is full, *users* are able to see them; but when the bottle is emptied and go back to the factory, these messages disappear.

------

I like these projects because they're using the affordances and restrictions of the network as a *playground*, a field of actions. For this reason, I feel very much inspired by movements such as [Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics), [Net art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_art), [Systems art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_art), [Actor–network theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory) and others - approaching networks with their agencies, values, ways they perform specific behaviours and ways we could - as designers, artists and scholars - investigate and question them.

These projects are, and its obvious in the case of Meireles' *Insertions into Ideological Circuits*,  what I would like to call **(subversive) Ouroboros strategies.**

![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Ouroboros_1.jpg)

Illustration of an Ouroboros: depicting a serpent biting its own tail.

In these cases, the affordances and restrictions of the network are taken into consideration in order to create a counter discourse; to return the network against its own ideological values.


- [x] Protocols: embeded values on language?

In the context of these modems investigations entangled inside internet's network, my goal is to investigate (using *sonic strategies*) how the network is shaped; how its proceduralities work. Reading [this excerpt of *The Rhetoric of Video Games*](http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/public_html/ruiz/EGDFall2013/readings/RhetoricVideoGames_Bogost.pdf) by Ian Bogost, I came accross the crucial idea of Procedural/Software authorship:

"Procedurality in this sense refers to the core practice of software authorship. Software is composed of algorithms that model the way things behave. To write procedurally, one authors code that enforces rules to generate some kind of representation, rather than authoring the representation itself. Procedural systems generate behaviors based on rulebased models; they are machines capable of producing many outcomes, each conforming to the same overall guidelines." (Bogost, 2008).

This clearly states that - obviously -  internet, like any other built-spaces, is not neutral. It states that internet embody specific values, behaviours, ideas - and that these ideas are deployed by code (which is part of internert's materiality). Internet is consequently an ecosystem of proceduralities "modeling the way things behave"(Bogost, 2008); setting guidelines for how *things* shoud behave through algorithms, protocols and others.

Although this is clear with Algorithms regulating, impacting and curating the way we perceive things in internet, Protocols' proceduralities are, in my sense, less obvious. 

However, Protocols do have a concrete impact on our interactions and on language; and this is obvious after the all debate regarding the so-called [Net Neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality).



# 2018-11-09 | 18:57


As a manifesto's draft:

- Both analog and digital
- Both delayed and immediate
- Inserting in the network, disrupting the network
- Protocol failures, protocol failure
- Against flow
- Both new and old
- slow sender, slow protocol
- embodying the cloud; from the cloud to the ground; from the cloud to the infrastructure

------

This is the pseudo code of what I'm trying to do:

      io.on('connection', (socket) => {
        socket.on('SEND_COORDINATES', function(data){
        
        // Here, send the data to the minomodem transmitter.
      	// Once, the data is outputted to sounds: 
      	// 1- use a minimodem receiver to decrypt back the sounds to text
     	// 2 - Then emit to the client to the new data
     	
        io.emit('RECEIVE_COORDINATES', data);
        })  
    });
However, when I'm now running a simple `minimodem` command in the terminal, I'm facing this issue:

```
E: Cannot create PulseAudio stream: Connection refused
```



# 2018-11-14 | 17:40


This issue is related to the OS version of the mac I'm using. I was able to try running a simple `minimodem --tx 100 Hello World!` command on a mac running with macOS Sierra and it worked. I'm now using CDA's laptops, the ones I use for my [2XTWEETSXMODEMSXTEXTXTWEET](http://2xtweetsxmodemsxtextxtweet.c-t-l-k.com/) project. These macs run with macOS Sierra as well. I will investigate what's happening with High Sierra later (didn't want to installed Mojave for now).


Anyway, I now replaced my pseudo-code with (regular?) code and it looks like this:

      io.on('connection', (socket) => {
        socket.on('SEND_COORDINATES', function(data){
        
          const dataToString = `${data.x.toString()}, ${data.x.toString()}`;
          var baudRate = "60"
          var child = spawn("minimodem", ["-t", `${baudRate}`]);
          child.stdin.write(dataToString);
    
      	  io.emit('RECEIVE_COORDINATES', data);
    
    	})
    });


Here, the coordinates coming from the client in an object form are first conversted to strings.

```
 const dataToString = `${data.x.toString()}, ${data.x.toString()}`;
```

Once this step is done, they are sent to the terminal embedded in the minimodem command:

```
var child = spawn("minimodem", ["-t", `${baudRate}`]);
child.stdin.write(dataToString);
```



# 2018-11-15 | 10:28


Going back to the manifesto's draft:

- Create a **data circuit** that is both analog and digital
- Disrupt digital data by analog one; Disrupt analog data by digital one.
- From signals to noise; From noise to signals
- **Protocol chaining: both with analog and digital components**
- Embody the trajectories of data in space
- Disrupt the data circuit by *screeching* modems
- Break the circuit by itself

------

- **THE ACTUAL PROCEDURALITY OF THE PROJECT:**

1. The user moves its cursor through the page

2. The cursor's positions (coordinates) are monitored in the client side of the app, displayed in the webpage and sent to the server. 


   ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-15%20at%2010.47.46%20AM.png) 

3. The same coordinates are sent to the server side (`server.js`) using  `sockets`. And, for now, as soon as they are areceived  in the server side, they're sent back to the client side using `sockets` again.



   ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-15%20at%2011.03.40%20AM.png)


- **MY INTENTIONS BEHIND THE PROJECT:**

This project is, for now, called Modem_Interface for a reason. The idea is the following: I would like to embed in internet's flow of interactions (between pages,  between user's inputs through the GUI) modems signals. In other words, I would like to insert into the *silent and cloudy* ideological circuit of internet analog and error-prone signals. 

Initially, I developed two ideas in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bUBO-7GQUZtH3D_C8OnMTckYUf8Rwwf_sxK29K3sMF0/edit?usp=sharing) I wanted to push further:

1. **Drawing on Idea #9:**  "The modem affordances are used to perform actions on the internet. You browse on the internet through the slow rhythm of modems (goes back to net neutrality?)." 

   This was still very vague but it's what I'm investigating here through coordinates. 

   - Through this *trajectoire* of coordinates, my goal is to insert in the server-side a modem transmission mode of this data. 

     *This is in pseudo-code what I want to achieve here:*      

           io.on('connection', (socket) => {
            	  socket.on('SEND_COORDINATES', function(data){
             
               const dataToString = `${data.x.toString()}, ${data.x.toString()}`;
               var baudRate = "60"
               var child = spawn("minimodem", ["-t", `${baudRate}`]);
               child.stdin.write(dataToString);
               
               // Now that the coordinates are outputted in modem signals
               // Run the receiver mode of minimodem in order to decrypt these signals
               
               // Once the signals are decrypted from modems to texts (coordinates):
               // Emit them back to the client
         
               io.emit('RECEIVE_COORDINATES', data);
         
         	})
         });

   - Because this process of decrypting data from modems > coordinates (and coordinates > modems) will be delayed and error-prone, what will be sent to the client will no longer be equal to what was originally sent to the server.

   - This inaccurate data will be used to position the cursor on the page. In other words, the user will experience a delay between the first coordinates he inputed and these ones.
     - [ ] Finalise the process so that the user's coordinates are determined by the data coming from the server
