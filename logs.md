Under the guidance of Pippin Barr, I'm approaching [DiSalvo](http://carldisalvo.com/)'s Adversarial Design applied to the context of (online) Game Design. Adversarial Design is a reference to Chantal Mouffe's notion of [Agonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonism).

------

"Agonism is a condition of disagreement and confrontation—a condition of contestation and dissensus. Those who espouse an agonistic approach to democracy encourage contestation and dissensus as fundamental to democracy." (DiSalvo, 2015)

"To claim that adversarial design does the work of agonism means that designed objects can function to prompt recognition of political issues and relations, express dissensus, and enable contestational claims and arguments." (DiSalvo, 2015)

DiSalvo's Adversarial Design consequently aims to approach design as a strategy to **embody Agonism**. In other words, Adversarial Design aims to do  **- through design strategies and dynamics -** "the work of Agonism".

In the [Master's Thesis Draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wq8xWYlTZ7X-dRnMwLcv9QUrnFLvfM-mthPl4srZJ48/edit?usp=sharing) I'm currently working on, I investigating internet from three different yet related *tensions* inherent to its materiality. I laid down these thoughts through this sort of manifesto:

-  "On the one hand, the internet appears as an immaterial system, characterised by light minimal user interfaces and clouds of data. On the hand, **internet is operated by a series of (wired) physical components: ranging from undersea cables, modems and routers**."

-  "On the one hand, internet appears as a silent stack of protocols, performing their actions transparently. On the other hand, **internet originated from sounds/sonic agencies; noisy telephone lines, using screeching modems in order to establish connections**."

-  "On the one hand, the internet appears as an immediate system of data transmission, characterized by a perfect data flow. On the other hand, **internet is punctuated by delays, failures and other frequent protocol anomalies**."

TO COME :

- [x] Protocols?
- [x] Internet's materiality vs ISP's marketing strategies?
- [x] Reveal/Explore internet's Materiality? Why?
- [x] Protocols: embeded values on language?
- [ ] Using Modems to make these values tangible?
- [ ] Translations?

This fact that internet is a messy, physical, odd, weird, delayed, irregular (and so on) network (or should I say infrastructure, which relates in my sense to a  much more tangible and concrete entity) highly interests me. While working on a previous game (the [MODEMGUESSINGGAME](https://github.com/cyruslk/MODEMGUESSINGGAME)), I read two books that highly influenced my thoughts and helped me reframe my ideas.

------

- [x] Protocols?

The first one is [Protocol: How Control Exists after Decentralization](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/protocol) by Alexander Galloway. I detailed the intersections between Galloway's book and my researches in [these logs](https://github.com/cyruslk/MODEMGUESSINGGAME/blob/master/logs.md) so I won't go back to the core ideas of the book; except that, to make it simple, even if Internet's infrastructure is distributed, there is a whole embeded system of **control and structure** in it; and **it resides largly in internet's transmitting protocols**.

There's a lot of [research being made these days](https://socialmediacollective.org/reading-lists/critical-algorithm-studies/) about the fact that Algorithms are normative apparatuses imposing on us their agency. But reading Galloway's Protocol made me realised that very little was made in order to investigate **from a critical perspective** the infrastucture where these algorithms operate (as well as others components of internet - all having an agency on the system itself - internet).

**Galloway's Protocol made me realize that transmitting protocols need consequently to be questioned, and that we need as scholars and researchers question the way they perform on us; the way they impose their embeded set of values and rules on us.**

------

The other one is [The Undersea Network](https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-undersea-network) by Nicole Starosielski.In her book, Starosielski investigates internet's physical infrastructure by exploring the role, the characteristics and the specificities of its [undersea cables](https://theconversation.com/in-our-wi-fi-world-the-internet-still-depends-on-undersea-cables-49936).

At the begining of the book, Starosielski clearly states that these cables "**transport 99 percent of all transoceanic digital communications**, including phone calls, text and e-mail messages, websites, digital images and video, and even some television (...). It is submarine systems, rather than satellites, that carry most of the Internet across the oceans." (Starosielski, 2015)

This consequently reveals that internet has a materiality, and that (part of) its materiality is tangible, geographically located; and that because internet was crafted this way, it enables all sorts of practices and counter-practices ([sabotages](https://globalnews.ca/news/4115233/russia-sabotage-undersea-fiber-optic-cables/), [resistance](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/28/egypt-undersea-cable-arrests) and [so on](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access)).

- [x] Internet's materiality vs ISP's marketing strategies?

However, what struck me the most through this book is the general position ISP (Internet Service Providers) defend regarding internet's infrastructure, following the idea that if "**the public doesn’t know about the importance of undersea cables, they will not think to contest or disrupt them.**" (Starosielski, 2015)

------

"Ash, who has worked for decades on undersea cable design and installation, he pressed me on my interest in making cables visible. “**Why would you want to know?**” he asked. “When you turn on a computer and you send an e-mail, do you really care how it works? No, you just want e-mail there, and you start drumming the table if it takes thirty seconds." (Starosielski, 2015)

I took some time to build and reflect on my last bot, the [slow sender meme bot](https://github.com/cyruslk/debord_slow_sender_meme). From [2XTWEETSXMODEMSXTEXTXTWEET](https://twitter.com/2XTXMXTXT) to [OROBOROGRAM](https://twitter.com/oroborogram), [PROCEDURAL_HAÏKUS](https://twitter.com/d__w__h) and these modem games/interactions I'll dive in very soon, there's definitely  body of problematics and investigations.

- [x] Reveal/Explore internet's Materiality? Why?

- CONTEXT : From this excerpt of Starosielski's book, ISP (and other private agents providing access internet) are striving to label internet as **a black-box**.

  A black-box is defined by **its opaque** characteristics. When we talk about a blak-box, we usually don't know the box itself: we know the inputs (the data passed in) and the outputs (the data *returned*) of this box without any knowledge of its internal workings.

  Approaching internet (and computers) as an ecology of black-boxes is frequent. From social-medias apps with [opaque ways to manage our datas](https://www.propublica.org/article/breaking-the-black-box-what-facebook-knows-about-you) to [algorithms](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) (with biases that we can't decrypt due do copyright), internet is composed of a variety of opaque boxes.

  This makes internet a very political space, where we - as citizens - are not aware of what's going on behind the curtains and are not in total control of our interactions with these spaces.

- CONTEXT : In addition, it's also clear that **code is law** - as Lawrence Lessig said it in his    [Code version 2.0'](http://codev2.cc/download+remix/Lessig-Codev2.pdf)s book. From protocols, to algorithms and therefore source code  (programming languages used to code and their embeded logics), internet is an ecology of values, norms and laws to abide by.

- CONTEXT : To draw on Golloway's Protocols, these components are where internet's system of control and structure reside. It's because these components are crafted these ways/enable these affordances and these possibilities that ISP and other agents are able to [monitor, listen and store our data,](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/all-the-data-facebook-google-has-on-you-privacy) change the ([spatio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_blocking)/[temporal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_throttling)) characteristics of the network and so on and so on.

- STATEMENT : Consequently, exploring (or questioning, revealing, breaking) the way internet (through its materiality) operate is in my sense a very political and subersive act.

  These thoughts are related to what [Experimental Jetset](https://www.experimentaljetset.nl/) expressed in their [Statement and Counter-Statement](https://www.experimentaljetset.nl/250/) book/index of interviews. I came across these thoughts three years ago and they still have an important impact on my approach of design.

  **Debord, Guy**

  "Right after we graduated from the Gerrit Rietveld Academie, there was a period in which we were really influenced by Guy Debord's *The Society of the Spectacle* (1967), especially the first chapter.
  Althought this was just a short period, the impact of this book is still showing in our work. In *The Society of the Spectacle*, Debord critically describes a society dominated by images and representations, and the alientation caused by this.
  We really agreed with this critique, and were thinking of ways to intrgrate it into our design work.

  We translated Debord's theory in a quite literal (and maybe slightly naive) way: we tried to design in a "non-representative" manner. **In other words, we wanted to design objects that would function not as images, but as material objects. Objects that would point to the physical world, the material base that was hidden underneath the world of images.**
  To give an example of this: we decided to never use photography in our work, as we believed that photography (especially full-color photogaphy) would imprison the viewer in an illusion, in a false representation of reality. For instance, when designing a poster, we would use typography only, so that the poster would be recognizable as just a printed piece of paper, not as an image. That also explains the use of white/empty space in our work: we want the viewer to use the paper itself, to cut through the world of images, and see the material base behind it. **By constantly referring to the material base behind everything, we want to make the viewer aware that this world is a makeable world, a world that is made by humans (and thus also has the potential to be changed by humans).**

  Nowadays, our views are a little less dogmatic. For an example, we new use photography in our work, occasionally.**But we're still very interested in the concept of design that refers to the material base: design that refers to itself, or to its own context."**

  *Marie Lousie (interview with deValence), issue 2, Édsitions F7, France, 2006*

I would also like to show here a serie of images/projects that had an impact on my thoughts and initiated in a way these modems projects and bots. I'll drop them here and explain how they relate to my researches.

- DISRUPTING THE FLOW


![alt text](https://66.media.tumblr.com/71a52c9b3787764fe53763f5dcdef63a/tumblr_o4zdxwrgGf1qixa76o1_640.png)




This image comes from [this project](http://theartofgooglebooks.tumblr.com/). It's basically a Google employee's Hand captured while digitalizing a book; contributing on Google's initiative/attemps to create "[the largest online body of human knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Books)". This image is very interesting because it reveals the process (by showing its failure). In other words it reveals that even if Google attempted to create a digital (and then smooth, seamless) archive of knowledge, this failed because of the Human intervention - because of the underlying Human factor. This image consequently disrupt the flow (and the Blackbox) Google attempted to create.

This image comes from [this project](http://9-eyes.com/). It's basically a guy throwing a bottle of coca-cola to the [Google Street View](https://www.google.com/streetview/understand/) car. This is also interesting because it shows the failure behind the "semingless" attempt: it shows the incident that goes against the appearance Google is communicating and - again - disrupt a smooth characteristics of the initiative.

- FROM MAPS TO TERRITORIES (...AND TRAJECTORIES)

This comes from [this project](http://theartofgooglebooks.tumblr.com/). It's a scan of the circulation slip with the dates when the book was borrowed. What I like with this image is that it reveals that these scans are a) coming from a physical object and that b) this object had therefore a trajectory in a variety of contexts.

This image is a [Byzantine Icon with a watermark on top](https://www.google.ca/search?q=watermarked+byzantine+icon&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiy_8Se5sXeAhUFm-AKHRTkBjsQ_AUIDigB&biw=1593&bih=857). Here there's a double trajectory happening inside the image: a) from the geographically located painting to the digitalized photo (the icon without losing aura); and b) from the photo to this watermarked Stock photo. What I like here is 1) that the image shows both part of the process and the final form and 2) that each of these shown trajectories are impacting the final form of the object.


- TRANSLATIONS THROUGH THE AFFORDANCES/RESTRICTIONS OF TOOLS


![alt text](http://res.cloudinary.com/www-c-t-l-k-com/image/upload/v1541709066/vd_qebzg1.jpg)

This image is a portrait of me by my grandma. It had been made in the context of a project I initiated for a publication asking researchers to reflect on perception. Through this project, I wanted to reflect on the role of the tool: on how the rool is impacting through its embeded affordances/restrictions the way we interact and perceive.  I was also interested to explore the way one language/state (words?) is being translated into another one (drawings?) and how this translation affects the information being passed.



# 2018-11-08 | 20:01

Started to work on the server side of the project. The main file of the server side is `server.js`. I'll work with `express` in order to manage the route between the server and the client (made using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)).

I'm also install socket.io both on the server and the client (React.js). ["Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server."](https://socket.io/docs/)



# 2018-11-09 | 11:37

I'll work with socket.io because it will help me to pass *in real time* data between the server and the client. By using sockets, I will be able to pass a variety of user's inputs from the client to the server side without **having to refresh the page.**

Here's a list of user's inputs I could use for this project using React's [SyntheticEvent](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html):

- Mouse coordinates + Mouse clicks
- Wheel events?
- Keyboard events?
- Media Events?

------

I'm finishing *Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System*, by Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost. This book is really interesting because it clearly shows how interactions (through the case study of the Atari Computer System) depends on the physicality of their underlying Platform: the cartridge, the microprocessor and so on.

It also clearly reflect that a design (and art) practice is always embeded into what Donald Schön calls a "reflection-in-action" process. The game designers and engineers behind *Tank*, *Combat*, *Pac-Man* and others were reflecting *in action* on their processes and ways to solve the variety of problems they encountered.

------

I'm in the process of building the core interactions between the `server` and the `client` side.

For now, the client side is able to send/receive data coming from the server. Here, the `Hello World` text is coming from the server and when I submit data using the input, it's sent to the server.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%202018-11-09%20%C3%A0%2012.14.45.png)

This idea is now to implement `sockets` in order to send data in real time without having to refresh the client page.

EDIT 1: I now have a script that displays the mouse coordinates. The idea is to pass these coordinates to the server now.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%202018-11-09%20%C3%A0%2016.45.16.png)


EDIT 2: In the `server.js`, I'm now able to retreive these coordinates using the `socket.on()` method of `socket.io`.

Here's the code where these coordinates are logged:

```
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    // console.log(socket.id);
    socket.on('SEND_COORDINATES', function(data){
        console.log(data);
        io.emit('RECEIVE_COORDINATES', data);
    })
});
```

Here is a screenshot of my terminal:
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%202018-11-09%20%C3%A0%2017.15.20.png)


EDIT 3: In the `App.js` of my client  side, I'm now able to retrieve the data sent from the server (and initiated on the client side). Here's the code where I'm logging this data:

    this.socket = io('localhost:5000');
        this.socket.on('RECEIVE_COORDINATES', function(data){
        console.log("this is the data", data);
        });
Here is a screenshot of my browser's console:
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%202018-11-09%20%C3%A0%2017.05.46.png)


EDIT 4: In the `App.js` again, I'm now able to retrieve the data coming from the server and display it in the webpage. This is the code I'm using here:

        this.socket = io('localhost:5000');
        this.socket.on('RECEIVE_COORDINATES', (data) => {
            this.setState({
              xx: data.x,
              yy: data.y
            })
        });
As soon as the data is in the [state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html), I'm displaying it like this:

```
<div>
	{this.state.xx}, {this.state.yy}
</div>
```

Here is a screenshot of my browser's console. The first set of coordinates are coming from the browser - the last ones from the server.

This is the [Simple Net Art Diagram](http://www.mtaa.net/mtaaRR/off-line_art/snad.html). It's very significative of the Net Art movement; and this image had a lot of imapct on my researches and my design practice. What I like with this is that it's quite absurd  - and at the same time very poetic. It clearly shows here that *the art* resides in the network, in the in-between spaces behind the objects; and that *the art* is more an interaction than a concrete and defined object   

![alt text](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T12/T12328_10.jpg)



[Cildo Meireles. *Insertions into Ideological Circuits: Coca-Cola Project* (1970)](https://www.daros-latinamerica.net/ensayo/cildo-meireles-insertions-ideological-circuits) In short, this project is located on the economic circuit of the coca-cola bottle inside the Brazilian chain of production and supply. Subversive messages ("YANKEES GO HOME!", recipes to create a Molotov cocktail) are written in white on these bottles. Therefore, when the bottle is full, *users* are able to see them; but when the bottle is emptied and go back to the factory, these messages disappear.

------

I like these projects because they're using the affordances and restrictions of the network as a *playground*, a field of actions. For this reason, I feel very much inspired by movements such as [Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics), [Net art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_art), [Systems art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_art), [Actor–network theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory) and others - approaching networks with their agencies, values, ways they perform specific behaviours and ways we could - as designers, artists and scholars - investigate and question them.

These projects are, and its obvious in the case of Meireles' *Insertions into Ideological Circuits*,  what I would like to call **(subversive) Ouroboros strategies.**

![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Ouroboros_1.jpg)

Illustration of an Ouroboros: depicting a serpent biting its own tail.

In these cases, the affordances and restrictions of the network are taken into consideration in order to create a counter discourse; to return the network against its own ideological values.


- [x] Protocols: embeded values on language?

In the context of these modems investigations entangled inside internet's network, my goal is to investigate (using *sonic strategies*) how the network is shaped; how its proceduralities work. Reading [this excerpt of *The Rhetoric of Video Games*](http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/public_html/ruiz/EGDFall2013/readings/RhetoricVideoGames_Bogost.pdf) by Ian Bogost, I came accross the crucial idea of Procedural/Software authorship:

"Procedurality in this sense refers to the core practice of software authorship. Software is composed of algorithms that model the way things behave. To write procedurally, one authors code that enforces rules to generate some kind of representation, rather than authoring the representation itself. Procedural systems generate behaviors based on rulebased models; they are machines capable of producing many outcomes, each conforming to the same overall guidelines." (Bogost, 2008).

This clearly states that - obviously -  internet, like any other built-spaces, is not neutral. It states that internet embody specific values, behaviours, ideas - and that these ideas are deployed by code (which is part of internert's materiality). Internet is consequently an ecosystem of proceduralities "modeling the way things behave"(Bogost, 2008); setting guidelines for how *things* shoud behave through algorithms, protocols and others.

Although this is clear with Algorithms regulating, impacting and curating the way we perceive things in internet, Protocols' proceduralities are, in my sense, less obvious.

However, Protocols do have a concrete impact on our interactions and on language; and this is obvious after the all debate regarding the so-called [Net Neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality).



# 2018-11-09 | 18:57


As a manifesto's draft:

- Both analog and digital
- Both delayed and immediate
- Inserting in the network, disrupting the network
- Protocol failures, protocol failure
- Against flow
- Both new and old
- slow sender, slow protocol
- embodying the cloud; from the cloud to the ground; from the cloud to the infrastructure

------

This is the pseudo code of what I'm trying to do:

      io.on('connection', (socket) => {
        socket.on('SEND_COORDINATES', function(data){
    
        // Here, send the data to the minomodem transmitter.
      	// Once, the data is outputted to sounds:
      	// 1- use a minimodem receiver to decrypt back the sounds to text
     	// 2 - Then emit to the client to the new data
    
        io.emit('RECEIVE_COORDINATES', data);
        })  
    });
However, when I'm now running a simple `minimodem` command in the terminal, I'm facing this issue:

```
E: Cannot create PulseAudio stream: Connection refused
```



# 2018-11-14 | 17:40


This issue is related to the OS version of the mac I'm using. I was able to try running a simple `minimodem --tx 100 Hello World!` command on a mac running with macOS Sierra and it worked. I'm now using CDA's laptops, the ones I use for my [2XTWEETSXMODEMSXTEXTXTWEET](http://2xtweetsxmodemsxtextxtweet.c-t-l-k.com/) project. These macs run with macOS Sierra as well. I will investigate what's happening with High Sierra later (didn't want to installed Mojave for now).


Anyway, I now replaced my pseudo-code with (regular?) code and it looks like this:

      io.on('connection', (socket) => {
        socket.on('SEND_COORDINATES', function(data){
    
          const dataToString = `${data.x.toString()}, ${data.x.toString()}`;
          var baudRate = "60"
          var child = spawn("minimodem", ["-t", `${baudRate}`]);
          child.stdin.write(dataToString);
    
      	  io.emit('RECEIVE_COORDINATES', data);
    
    	})
    });


Here, the coordinates coming from the client in an object form are first conversted to strings.

```
 const dataToString = `${data.x.toString()}, ${data.x.toString()}`;
```

Once this step is done, they are sent to the terminal embedded in the minimodem command:

```
var child = spawn("minimodem", ["-t", `${baudRate}`]);
child.stdin.write(dataToString);
```



# 2018-11-15 | 10:28


Going back to the manifesto's draft:

- Create a **data circuit** that is both analog and digital
- Disrupt digital data by analog one; Disrupt analog data by digital one.
- From signals to noise; From noise to signals
- **Protocol chaining: both with analog and digital components**
- Embody the trajectories of data in space
- Disrupt the data circuit by *screeching* modems
- Break the circuit by itself

------

- **THE ACTUAL PROCEDURALITY OF THE PROJECT:**

1. The user moves its cursor through the page

2. The cursor's positions (coordinates) are monitored in the client side of the app, displayed in the webpage and sent to the server.

3. The same coordinates are sent to the server side (`server.js`) using  `sockets`. And, for now, as soon as they are areceived  in the server side, they're sent back to the client side using `sockets` again.



   ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-15%20at%2011.03.40%20AM.png)


- **MY INTENTIONS BEHIND THE PROJECT:**

This project is, for now, called Modem_Interface for a reason. The idea is the following: I would like to embed in internet's flow of interactions (between pages,  between user's inputs through the GUI) modems signals. In other words, I would like to insert into the *silent and cloudy* ideological circuit of internet analog and error-prone signals.

Initially, I developed two ideas in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bUBO-7GQUZtH3D_C8OnMTckYUf8Rwwf_sxK29K3sMF0/edit?usp=sharing) I wanted to push further:

1. **Drawing on Idea #9:**  "The modem affordances are used to perform actions on the internet. You browse on the internet through the slow rhythm of modems (goes back to net neutrality?)."

   This was still very vague but it's what I'm investigating here through coordinates.

   - Through this *trajectoire* of coordinates, my goal is to insert in the server-side a modem transmission mode of this data.

     *This is in pseudo-code what I want to achieve here:*      

           io.on('connection', (socket) => {
            	  socket.on('SEND_COORDINATES', function(data){
    
               const dataToString = `${data.x.toString()}, ${data.x.toString()}`;
               var baudRate = "60"
               var child = spawn("minimodem", ["-t", `${baudRate}`]);
               child.stdin.write(dataToString);
    
               // Now that the coordinates are outputted in modem signals
               // Run the receiver mode of minimodem in order to decrypt these signals
    
               // Once the signals are decrypted from modems to texts (coordinates):
               // Emit them back to the client
    
               io.emit('RECEIVE_COORDINATES', data);
    
         	})
         });

   - Because this process of decrypting data from modems > coordinates (and coordinates > modems) will be delayed and error-prone, what will be sent to the client will no longer be equal to what was originally sent to the server.

   - This inaccurate data will be used to position the cursor on the page. In other words, the user will experience a delay between the first coordinates he inputed and these ones.

     - [ ] Finalise the process so that the user's coordinates are determined by the data coming from the server

2. **Drawing on idea #11:** "Every time a user access an hyperlink, it fetches the content of the page (related to the hyperlink), a) it transmits the content by modem signals; b) a modem receiver decrypt these modems signals back to source code; and c) the newly generated code is opened in the browser." ...I'll go back to this later.



# 2018-11-15 | 15:12

Going back to the code for now:

I realised that (obviously), it's quite hard to manipulate in real time the cursor position. I came acrocss this [stack overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4752501/move-the-mouse-pointer-to-a-specific-position) and it's, in fact, missing to the JavaScript API. **It's also because the mouse element is not belonging to the browser but by the Platform's system.** While someone is suggesting to run a quick [`c` script](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2008051406323031) in the backend, another idea is to remove the clicker, replace it by a *false* image of a clicker and handle clickevents [like this](http://jsfiddle.net/jaakkytt/9uczV/). Another idea would be to use mouse-lock to lock the cursor to specific coordinates that relates to the data coming from the server (and piped into `minimodem`).

------

**First, I'm going to remove the cursor style in the Client App:**

```
  componentDidMount() {
      this.updateWindowDimensions();
      window.addEventListener('resize', this.updateWindowDimensions);
      return document.body.style.cursor = "none";
    }
```

**Now, I will find, add, and anmimate the fake cursor:**

1. Found [this cursor image.](https://bit.ly/2QJEezD)

2. Added it in the `render()` section of the App.js file.

3. Added a `position:absolute`  and a `width: 20px;`. For now, the fake cursor *is stuck* at the middle of the page.


   ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-15%20at%204.23.36%20PM.png)

4. Done! The *fake* cursor is now following the coordinates coming from the server. In order to do this, I added a dynamic `style` element in the image tag, in order to change its position based on the data received from the server and stored in the [state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html). If I stop the server, the mouse freezes.

   The interaction is already a bit glitchy and I love it!

**Now, I'll add an iframe and figure out how to handle clicks:**


EDIT 1: Alright :(  - So I added a full width/height iframe and I changed the `z-index` of my cursor image to be displayed on top of the iframe but I ran into a problem: [I won't be able to hide the cursor on a iframe because of CORS.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20102248/hiding-the-users-cursor-over-iframe-possible)

EDIT 2: Found a [CSS hack](http://jsfiddle.net/dyV7L/). However, this basically just adds a div on top of the iframe. So it doesn't allows me to click on the links of the `iframe`, neither scroll it.

EDIT 3: HOWEVER, I have an idea: I could just remove the cursor (and lock the iframe) when the user move.
This will, in turn, allow the user to click on hyperlinks and scroll, assuming that you don't scroll (or click) when you move the cursor.

# 2018-11-16 | 11:49

On the technical side, what need to be fixed:

- On the server side
- [ ] Launch two child processes at the same time.
- [ ] When  var child = spawn("minimodem", ["-r", `${baudRate}`]); launches, pipes it back to the console.
- On the client
- [ ] As soon as the user scrolls, it changes the hide-cursor div to `display:none` and release the iframe.
- [ ] Do I really need sockets?

------

BUT BEFORE: MINIMODEM IS QUITE UNSTABLE, DUE TO THIS ERROR:

```
E: Cannot create PulseAudio stream: Connection terminated
```

SINCE ITS THE CORE COMPONENT OF MY PROJECT, I NEED TO FIND A WAY TO FIX THIS OR FIND AN ALTERNATIVE. FOR NOW, I RE-INSTALLED BREW, TRIED TO UPGRADE MINIMODEM. I'LL TRY TO RE-INSTALL PULSEAUDIO AND MINIMODEM NOW.

EDIT 1: I INSTALLED FIRST PULSEAUDIO, THEN MINIMODEM.

EDIT 2: I'M NOW REBOOTING THE LAPTOP.

EDIT 3: Seems to work now...Let see how it goes.

This is what the design look like for now. It's an iframe of Wikipedia with the fake cursor on it. Every time the user moves the cursor, minimodem fires. However, for now the analog circuit I aim to create is not yet completed, because the signals are not decrypted and sent back to the client.

------

For now, I'm still working on this front-end hack I talked earlier - and I'm still not able to remove the div on top of the user when the user is inactive. Here's what I'm trying to achieve:

1. Using [`react-idle-timer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-idle-timer), I'm listening to the user's events.

2. When the user is inactive after 1000 Milliseconds, I'm removing the div from the DOM

3. Whe the user is active, I'm adding back the div in the DOM.

         _onActive(e) {
             console.log('user is active', e);
             this.setState({
               showDiv: true
             })
         }
            _onIdle(e) {
             console.log('user is idle', e);
             this.setState({
               showDiv: false
             })
           }

Meeting with Pippin.

As an alternative to minimodem, we came acoss an interesting idea: using a TTS module in order to output (Speak! Shout!) in real time the user's coordinates in binary codes. The idea would be the following: a) use a text to speech module to sonify these coordinates to binary codes; then b) use a *speech to text* module (maybe [this Watson package](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/speech-to-text/)) to convert back the sonified binary codes to their digital form; and c) send back the binary codes to the client coordinates.

I like this idea.


# 2018-12-30 | 23:35

This CORS problem makes the project more complicated than it was intented. However, I came accross an option that seems interesting to explore: this `python` package: https://pypi.org/project/pynput/

------

From their documation:

```
This library allows you to control and monitor input devices.

Currently, mouse and keyboard input and monitoring are supported.
```

This could be a good alternative because it's not happening on the browser (at the opposite of this current  app that uses ` JavaScript`) but on the operating system. Maybe there's a similar package that runs with `node` and that would be great because I won't have to learn Python (I know very little for now but its on my learning list).

------

EDIT: I found this awesome `npm module` that does the same features (keyboard & mouse input simulation...): http://robotjs.io/docs/examples

I runed [the example script](http://robotjs.io/docs/syntax#mouse) they provided and since it's happening on the operarting system, there's no CORS issues and the cursor is behaving normally when hovering on webpages (turn to pointer when on hyperlinks etc).

------

Here is now the updated procedurality WITHOUT MINIMODEM:

1. The client (still React.js) fires a mouse coordinate event to the server.

2. The mouse icon of the client DOES NOT need to be hidden now

3. The mouse coordinates is received on the server side and passed to the robojs API - exact piece of code: `robot.moveMouse(x, y);` .

4. That's it I guess. I don't need to `emit back`  the coordinates to the client using `RECEIVE_COORDINATES` . As a result the mouse is looped from the client to the server and altered from the server back to the client.

   EDIT: I'LL INVERSE THE COORDINATES COMING FROM THE BROWSER TO MAKE SURE THIS IS WORKING AS EXPECTED.



# 2019-01-24 | 12:17


I worked again on the server side and these are two `minimodem + node` options I could use for the project.  For the `pulseaudio` package that need to be run in order to create a connection with `minimodem`, I'm for now launching the program manually, then starting the application. I might find a way to automate this later.  I documented these two options in videos.

1. The first option is to instantiate the minimodem program every time a socket is received using `child.stdin.write()`,   then kill the child using `child.stdin.end()`.  [Here's a video of what this option looks like.](https://vimeo.com/313030252)  

   In this case, when I'm moving the cursor then using a new terminal to `minimodem --rx 100` the content, the position (for now I'm only using the x coordinates) is received and parsed correctly ~20% of the time.

   ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/modem_browser_1.png)

   ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/modem_browser_1_2.png)


   The rest of the time, minimodem is not able to correctly retrieve the modem signal and outputs gibberish to the console. This is probably due to the fact that the signal outputted gets killed very quickly. It could be an option to investigate to add a timer to kill it after x seconds.

   ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/modem_browser_1_3.png)


   At the code's level, this is what's happening inside the `socket ` every time a coordinates has been received from the client to the server:

   ```javascript
   io.on('connection', (socket) => {
       socket.on('SEND_COORDINATES', function(data){
         const dataToString =
          `${data.x.toString()},${data.y.toString()}`;
             var child = spawn("minimodem", ["-t", "100"]);
             child.stdin.write(dataToString);
             child.stdin.end();
       })
   });
   ```

2. The other option is to launch minimodem using a pipe `|` command, then write directly the coordinates inside the terminal where minimodem is running, using `process.stdout.write();` [Here's a video of what this option looks like.](https://vimeo.com/313054527)  

   In this case, the coordinates are correctly decrypted more frequently but there's a delay that makes that causes the program to output the same coordinates for a long time even tho the cursor moved. Interesting fact: even if the mouse does not move, the program continue to decrypt coordinates that are not exactly the same, like in the image below:

   ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/modem_browser_2_2.png)

   Howver, when the cursor moves very slowly and along a few pixels, the coordinates are correctly received:

   ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/modem_browser_2_1.png)

    Somtimes, it appears also to render gibberish too:
   ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/modem_browser_2.png) At the code's level, this is what's happening:

   1. First, the `minimodem` gets called when the command is launched:
      `node server.js | minimodem --tx 100`
   2.  Then, inside the socket: `process.stdout.write(dataToString);`

To clarify a few things, these are buggy but it's a parameter I'ld like to play with. Since I'm working with the agency of protocols (in the case of the network neutrality), I'm interested to use this transmitting protocol (and the way it performs) as a frame (- as the main entity) from which our interactions will depend.  In other words, I'm interested through this idea of (silent network) analog insertion to *infect* the network with irregular, slow, not so efficient technologies and apparatuses.

------

Since I'm now able to fire a `minimodem` analog signal (transporting embodied data) every time a socket (aka, a real time event) is launched, here's a list of small explorations/prototypes I could do - to draw on my idea of a 'modem browser' - a browser where the user need to obey to the modem's rules and temporal restrictions:

- When you click on an hyperlink in order to visit another page, the source code of the page you're about to visit is a) fetched into its textual format (using a [curl package](https://christianheilmann.com/2009/12/18/curl-your-view-source-of-the-web/)), then b) outputted from text > modem, then c) decrypted from modem > text, and finally attemped to be open as a webpage.
  - EDIT: I can't really do this because of css stylesheets (...I could curl the website HTML page on my local machine but the page won't includes styling.)
    - However, an option to consider would be to send the URL by modem,  decrypt it back and use it to access the page.
    - Another option would be to use a bash command to ` curl pippinbarr.com > source.txt`, pipe the text to minimodem, get the signal to text back and replace the original dom of the targeted website by this minimodem'ed one.
      - EDIT: I was able to directly send the HTML of a website to mimimodem using
- A chat interaction: when you type your text to be sent online through the chat, this text is first a) translated from text > modem, then b) translated back from modem > text and c) sent to the chat. This idea could be interesting (and playful?) if there's multipe persons interacting inside the same space at the same time - and therefore where the outptutted modem signals get mixed.

On the technical side, if I don't want to use multiple machines (one for sending the content, one for receiving the content), I need to find a way to run these programs in parrallel.


# 2019-01-24 | 19:08

I love this image. Probably because of the way they illustrated the step at the middle (which is where the protocol establishes a connection). The blackbox explained.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/master/img_process/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-15%20at%2011.42.28%20AM.png)



# 2019-01-26 | 19:33

I'm working in parrallel for the mouse interaction and the URL interaction. The URL interaction will probably have its own branch soon. For now, this is where I'm at with the mouse interaction idea:

1. I first open pulseaudio, then launch the server like this: `node server.js | minimodem --tx 100`
2. Then, I'm running manually (for now) ` minimodem --rx 100 > coordinates.txt`, so that all the retreived txt > modem > text coordinates are going to a .txt file.
3. I'm formatting the coordinates passed to the transmitter like this: `[coordinateX, coordinateY]`.
   1. The idea is now to `fs.read()` the content of the file, translate it to an array (using `][ ` as the separator) and send back to the client the last element of this array.

------

For option 1 when minimodem is called - then killed - every time a socket fires , this is what the `coordinates.txt` file loooks like:

```
[0, 0][99, 218][102, 217][107, 217][134, 210][177, 202][233, 197][290, 195][325, 195][349, 195][372, 196][380, 198][328, 298][328, 299][319, 417][370, 364][367, 233][268, 247]≠¿Mæµ<[301, 406]Z¯ﬂ%˝{í[373, 393]íˇú*0^ˇ˜Ó[730, 649]ﬂ"ﬁ[873, 632][178, 660]Û Øk–ŒvØ◊ˇ≠◊üÔ[62˚&«=85]<Âıp[377,461][858,ìí¢ ]/˛œˇÛü»82Üõ5[385,432]7qU‰?Ì6[3±{=77?ö]ﬁÒ•h'6Ñ
```

For option 2 when minimodem is only called one time then runs in the background - and where modem signals are longer , this is what the file looks like:

```
[346, 435][328, 451][711, 104][758, 105][763, 116][767, 105][780, 105][773, 113][175, 199][31, 222][32, 222][33, 222][38, 220][44, 219][51, 219][56, 219][59, 219][61, 219]
```

------

Either I will use `string.split("][")` directly, either I will a) make sure only numbers and `][` are added to the file and b) run  `string.split("][")` .



# 2019-01-29 | 18:17

Exploring these two options and option one where I kill the process each time gives very limited results - mostly modem gibberish. I runed the program with the code 1 and this is what was piped to the `coordinates.txt` file:

```
383,1236ˇí43ÓwﬁŒòÃˇü792,242wˇMí7s∑ﬂ79ªÆõ≤öMÃê◊∂˜ﬂ1ˇ˛˚Ÿ”õÁ794,242≤ˇ
```

With this option it's only when I'm moving very slowly the mouse that the text in this file have a chance to be representative. Otherwise it's modem gibberish.

The other option is more representative and pipes to the `coordinates.txt` file something much more accurate - but there's a delay (probably caused by the way minimodem was built) that makes the application less interesting: because even you don't move the app still sends signals - which is quite weird.

However I found an interesting way to tackle this when I went back to the code of my [2XTWEETSXMODEMSXTEXTXTWEET](https://twitter.com/2XTXMXTXT) project: playing with the sound level of the machine.

The procedure of the script would then be the following:

1. When the client moves the mouse, write the coordinates to the console with the minimodem running.
2. When the client stops moving the mouse, shut down the sound of the machine. The signal won't be outputted and the minimodem --rx will stop decrypting.

I tried to mimick the experience turning off the sound when my mouse was not moving and turning on the sound whwn it was and this is what the `coordinates.txt` file looked like:

```
≤íb¢íí][662, 422][662, 422][662, 423][662, [661, 424][66≤äb¢í¢][661, 61, 424][662, 4¢í¢][662, 424¢í¢][662, 423][¶][662, 423][&][663, 422][6í][665, 423][66][672, 428][675”¬b¢öí][681, 434¢ö∫][688, 438][Ç][693, 441][69µe ≤b¢¢ö][698, 444 444][701, 445]
```

It's still buggy but that's part of the experience.

I worked on new branch called [stop_sound](https://github.com/cyruslk/Modem_Interface/tree/stop_sound) where i tried this idea of modulating the speakers volume from 0 to 100%  based on the socket. I also started to use the content piped by the modem `--rx 100` and send it back to the client inside its own socket.

Here's the procedurality of the all program:

1.  The mouse from the webpage is hidden. The mouse is replaced by a fake icon of a mouse.
2. When the user mousemove, it sends the coordinates to the server **(socket A - server)** and fires minimodem at volume 100.
3. There's a timer that listens for the mousemove:
   1. When the use stops mousemoving after `1000ms`, its send a new socket **(socket B - server)** to the server saying basically that the user is inactive.
   2. Once this socket is received to the server, it mutes the volume - sets the volume to 0. This impacts the modem `--rx 100` which in turn stops trying to decrypt the sonified coordinates
4.  In parrallel to the program, the `minimodem --rx 100` redirects everything written to the `stdout` to the `coordinates.txtx` file.
   1. Inside **socket B - server**, the file is written, splitted into an array of coordinates. The last two elements of this array are sent back to the client.
5. These two elements become the `x` and `y ` position coordinates of the fake icon.

------


Array coming from the server and sent to the client via **socket B - server**:

Last two coordinates/ number-ish splited from this array:

------

Here's now [a video of what it looks like](https://vimeo.com/314274269) when i'm replace the cursor by a fake icon that depends of these coordinates coming from the server. The sound is not very loud so don't hesistate to turn it on at 100%. We can see here that the fake icon is indeed moving based on the received data. Stills from the video:
